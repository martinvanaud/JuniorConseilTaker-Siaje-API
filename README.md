# JuniorConseilTaker Siaje API

## About the project

SIAJE is the first professional information system developed for Junior-Enterprises.

It offers an efficient solution through its dashboard, which allows you, at each connection, to have an eye on the different key indicators of your Junior-Enterprise like the turnover, its monthly evolution or your todos.
It allows you to manage your student "pool" in the most efficient way possible: skills, contact information, administrative documents...

This software has no official API and this is an attempt to develop an easy and efficient one
